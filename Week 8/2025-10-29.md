## 📝 Notes / Thoughts:
Given that there isn't enough time to pour into all my different endeavours, I have to maximize the little time that I do have. This essentially means trying to work "smarter"/more productively. Today I encountered a bug that was related to css styling. Typically, I would have spent hours trying to fix that myself (because of my dogged belief of being as minimally reliant on chatGPT as possible). I decided to use chatGPT today and with its help, I fixed the issue in about 10 mins (obviously I had to really explain the problem and go through different iterations of solutions). So the problem had to do with position sticky in a `flex container` that has `align-items` set to `center`. Because of the mismatch of scroll directions between the parent container and the sticky element, the functionality breaks.

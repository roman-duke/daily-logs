## 🎯 Mini Goals for the Day:
- "Tasks at work" ✅
- Play at least 1 games of Chess and analyze. ✅
## 📖 What I worked on:
- ("Work") Worked on creating a mock service to continue development on the frontend. - 8hrs
- Played and analyzed 1 game of Chess - 20 mins.
## 📝 Notes / Thoughts:
It was a really long day, with quite a bit of hours poured into work. Anyways, I decided to try an ORM (Prisma) for the repository/data access layer of the mock backend that I wrote. Hmmm, I'd say there's quite a bit of abstraction to the point where knowledge of SQL is almost not necessary. I don't know if I like this yet (I'll continue a bit more). However, in my nostro tempo project, I'd give kysely (just a query builder) a shot; there's much less abstraction and bloat, more granular control over raw sqls, etc.

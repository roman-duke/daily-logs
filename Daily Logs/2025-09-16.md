## Date: 16th September, 2025.

## 📖 What I worked on:
- Nostro Tempo backend development - 5hrs.
- Solved 3 Chess Puzzles on Lichess - 20 mins

## 📝 Notes / Thoughts:
First real experience with backend development and, naturally, there are so many things to learn. I am spending a good chunk of the time researching and reading relevant best practices. Also, I think I have to read the Professor's Frisby's Adequate Guide to Functional Programming book (it's just about 200 pages I think, so ideally I should be able to grind it in 5 days or something) to get a proper foundation on basic functional programming concepts; the code I am writing is literally just vibes.

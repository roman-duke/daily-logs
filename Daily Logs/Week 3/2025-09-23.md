## 📖 What I worked on:
- Play and Analyze 2 Chess games: 1 hr

## 📝 Notes / Thoughts:
Mann, the amount of hours I am wasting due to my mental state is killing me. I just can't bring myself to do anything and work keeps piling up. Life is really rough. But I have to do something; if I stay in this state for too long, I am only going to get more miserable.

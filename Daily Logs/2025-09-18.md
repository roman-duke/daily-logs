## Date: 18th September, 2025.

## 📖 What I worked on:
- Solved 3 Chess Puzzles on Lichess and played a Chess game - 1hr
- Reading Typst documentation - 45 mins
- Read Database Design for Mere Mortals - 1hr

## 📝 Notes / Thoughts:
It was a pretty unproductive day. The main positive was getting to read the first Chapter of _Database Design for Mere Mortals_. Essentially, it served as very quick introduction to databases and the relational model, with a bit of historical context.

## Date: 17th September, 2025.

## 📖 What I worked on:
- Nostro Tempo backend development - 2.5 hrs.
- Solved 3 Chess Puzzles on Lichess - 20 mins

## 📝 Notes / Thoughts:
Things are starting to get really sketchy and I am largely winging it. Current problem is trying to clearly define boundaries and separate concerns. The service layer, which ideally should be responsible for the business logic and should be concerned with what data to get, is now being involved with implementation details of how to get said data.

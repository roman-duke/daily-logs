## 🎯 Mini Goals for the Day:
- "Tasks at work". ✅
- Finish reading chapter 1 of the "How to Prove it" book. 
- Work on the CRUD for categories and then creating sessions in nostro tempo.
- Play 2 games of Chess and Analyze. ✅
- Solve 10 Healthy Mix of Lichess puzzles.
- Watch Daniel Naroditsky's content. ✅
## 📖 What I worked on:
- Product research for the tasks at work. - 3hrs
- Played 5 games of Chess and analysed 4. - 1.5hrs
- Watched Daniel Naroditsky's speed run video. 1.5hrs
## 📝 Notes / Thoughts:
Basically all of the chess games were quite terrible. To that end, quite a bit of rating points have been lost. 

Doing product research can be quite daunting and exhausting though.

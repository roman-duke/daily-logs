## Date: 7th November, 2025.
## 🎯 Mini Goals for the Day:
- Play and analyzse least 2 game of Chess. ✅
- Watch a bit of Naroditsky's speedrun video. 
- Solve at least 5 Healthy Mix of Lichess Puzzles. ✅
- Finish Single Player Mode in the Nostro Tempo application.
- Look into kysely and how it can be integrated into Nostro Tempo.
## 📖 What I worked on:
- Played and analysed 4 games of Chess - 1hr.
- Solved 6 Healthy Mix of Lichess puzzles - 1hr.
- Worked on the relations builder in Nostro tempo (grouping and nesting the flattened join results returned by the db). - 2.5hrs
## 📝 Notes / Thoughts:
I have been more consistent with solving the Lichess puzzles lately. Training sometimes can be boring, but it's especially nice when you reap the rewards in games. I applied for a hackathon and got in. I plan to demo the MVP of Nostro Tempo for this hackathon, but with this current pace I am going at that would not be feasible. It's about 13 days left, let's see what we can do.

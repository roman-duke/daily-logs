This repository is meant to serve as a place to dump the summary of activities in my day that pertain to things I have classified as "work". It's also a way for me to track the amount of hours in a day I channel in to these self-labeled productive endeavours.

I've tried to-do lists multiple times in the past and it's usually quite difficult to strike out all the items consistently because of a whole host of reasons. First, the to-do lists usually accounted for both hours and amount of work to be done. This was always set up to fail because predicting how much time an unexplored activity in a certain field (where one has limited experience) is going to take is next to impossible. Second, it can be pretty hard to account for unforeseen activities that may come up (or putting it more stringently, "*noise to the system*"). The unforeseen events may also even stem from the work itself in cases where tunnel visioning happens or being stuck on a problem for much longer than anticipated.

In this approach, which one could term a glorified to-do list system, at the start of each day I would have a set of different fields of which I should engage in deep work and then allocate time blocks to each of them. At the end of the day, the total hours poured into these endeavours would be recorded. Based on this system, the measure of what constitutes a successful day might be hard. I don't particularly want to focus on the hours spent because number of hours dedicated to something doesn't necessarily equal quality of work done or progress made, although one could argue that there is some correlation especially if the practice of "deep work" was being exercised. Ideally, there should be some form of rating for each day, but as I have outlined above there really is no sure-fire way. I suppose we just stick to the number of hours worked for now? (Also, it is important that I read or at least watch a YouTube video summary on Scott Young's book on Ultralearning)

This daily tracking habit is ideally to be sustained for about 4 - 6 months, as I think that's enough time for one to completely stick to a new schedule/system (although that is even debatable).

## Date: 14th November, 2025.
## 🎯 Mini Goals for the Day:
- Chess (Estimated time - 1.5hrs) ✅
	- Play and analyse least 2 game of Chess. 
	- Solve at least 10 Healthy Mix of Lichess Puzzles.
- "Tasks at Work" (Estimated time - 3hrs) :✅
	- Work on authentication api integration on the frontend.
- Drawing Challenge Practice begins! (Estimated time - 3hrs) ✅:
	- Pick a target portrait to draw at the end of the challenge (a good picture of Temi Otedola).
	- Attempt to draw the chosen image of Temi Otedola.
## 📖 What I worked on:
- "Tasks at work" (updated design system and reworked the ui for the auth.) - 6hrs.
- Drew a portrait of Temi Otedola with no prior practice whatsoever - 2hrs.
- Played and analysed 2 games of Chess. W1L1 - 1hr.
## 📝 Notes / Thoughts:
Dealing with state management complexities on the frontend and having to also think about ui and user experience can be pretty annoying. But for some reason, once I start working on any frontend it's quite hard for me to freestyle the ui and ux. It takes soo much time. I dread when I start working on the frontend of Nostro tempo, haha.

Based on the crap I drew today, I am so far from being half decent at drawing. It'd be interesting to see how the drawing challenge for the next 30 days would go. The main approaches to improving would be directness, drilling/repetition and continuous assessment for quick active feedback (the main themes from Scott Young's ultra learning book).

Welp, my Chess rating still remains the same. Sadly, not enough time can be poured into it to improve as much as I'd like. This doesn't mean I would abandon it completely though. Solving puzzles and playing (even if just one game) would still go a long way.

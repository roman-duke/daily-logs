## 📖 What I worked on:

- Worked on the first version of single player mode in Nostro tempo. - 5hrs
## 📝 Notes / Thoughts:
lolll, I have been working on first version of Nostro Tempo for the longest now. Massive skill issue here. Using Express, which is quite unopinionated has made development kind of slow, particularly because of the analysis-paralysis I encounter basically at every decision I have to make.

I am to start the daily drawing practice from tomorrow, for the YouTube video that I plan to release sometime in December.

## 📝 Notes / Thoughts:
I think I might be spreading myself too thin here. Trying to juggle all of these different challenging endeavours isn't easy by any stretch of the imagination. I have tried to shave off as much time-wasting activities as possible, in order to maximise productive hours but it seems that's not exactly enough. I think it all boils down to skill issue, though haha.

I didn't have the time to Leetcode or work on nostro tempo this weekend and I feel bad about that.

Anyways, I like the rhythm that's been developed over the last few days. Let's try to keep taking each day by the scruff of the neck, haha.

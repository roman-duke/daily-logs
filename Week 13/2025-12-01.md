## Date: 1st December, 2025.
## 🎯 Mini Goals for the Day:
- Chess (Estimated time - 30mins) ✅:
	- Play and analyse at least 1 game of Chess. 
- "Tasks at Work" (Estimated total time - 8hrs):
	- Begin coding the web design for the schools.
## 📖 What I worked on:
- Played and analysed 4 games of Chess. W2 - 30mins
- "Tasks at Work" (did the proof of concept for the custom ssg and then I continued work on the dashboard). - 7.5hrs spent coding.
## 📝 Notes / Thoughts:
Actually getting a proof of concept for the custom ssg was a serious pain. From the placement of the tsconfig files, to setting up the build pipeline via npm scripts to configuring the vite build options, the hurdles I had to get past were multitudinous. I was finally able to have something set up, but now I still have to figure out the deployment and how the backend that triggers the build and deplyoment would be set up. 

I have somehow still been able to make some progress in Chess despite being on maintenance mode. I guess I just keep reviewing my games and drilling certain weaknesses that I have whenever the time slot opens up.

I missed the Drawing practice again today. I have to combine 2 days into one tomorrow (this would imply a 6-hr drawing session). But given the amount of work-related tasks that I have to do, I would just do a single session tomorrow and then combine two sessions on Wednesday.

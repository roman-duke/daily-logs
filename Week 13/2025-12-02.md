## 📝 Notes / Thoughts:
So I learnt quite a bit today while working on the website builder feature. Apparently the core architecture of a website builder application involves storing an internal representation of the DOM (typically as a JSON tree). This ensures a WYSIWYG kind of website building process. This JSON tree can then be parsed and rendered by a renderer. This rendered site is what is published/deployed. I also experimented a bit with iframes and got to learn about how communication happens between the embedded application and its parent (using `postMessage`). 

I was only able to work on "work-related" tasks today and it was actually quite involving. Virtually the whole day was dedicated to it. A demo is coming up tomorrow, so I just decided to tunnel vision on this, I guess. Obviously this is to the detriment of the other activities that I have to do. Man, there's barely any time lolll. We have to keep moving forward, I guess.

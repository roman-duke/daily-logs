## 📝 Notes / Thoughts:
Well, it was a relatively okay day I'd say. I came across this new css color model called oklch (OK Lightness Chroma Hue) which is meant to closely mimic the way humans perceive colors. I played around with a few colors while working on the design system at work. The approach I'd previously taken in all my React projects in building a design system had been so terrible. Going through the [`class variance authority`](https://cva.style/docs) library was pretty insightful. 

Next stop is getting better at modeling frontend applications as state machines (just more practice with state management and reading source code of popular open source projects, I suppose).

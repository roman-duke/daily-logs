## Date: 9th October, 2025.

## üéØ Mini Goals for the Day:
- Play 2 games and analyse the unanalysed games from earlier this week. ‚úÖ
- Work on the tasks that are due soon at my job. ‚úÖ
- Solve 5 Healthy Mix of Chess puzzles on Lichess.
- Finish the "dto" part of nostro tempo and begin work on creating sessions.
## üìñ What I worked on:
- Continued reading chapter 1 on the "How to Prove it" book.
- "Tasks at work".
- Played 3 games of Chess.
## üìù Notes / Thoughts:
I don't understand the concept of covariance in type theory. Also, I came across something I don't particularly understand. Observe the following:

``` ts
declare const eren: string[] | number[];
declare const mikasa: string;

eren.includes(mikasa); //-----------> The following errors because searchElement in the includes method is now of type `never`. 
```

I would've guessed the type of search element in the includes method would be inferred to be the union of `string` and `number`, but it appears to be the intersection which is of type `never`. I need to go through some of type theory again.

A rather interesting day saddled with a great deal of imposter syndrome.

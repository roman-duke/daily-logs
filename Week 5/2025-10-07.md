- Started watching Alex's podcast - [`Nihilism: An In-Depth Discussion`](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bJk00UM_9o&list=PLMDve3WeC9qAidJ-sVarJXjy5blvar8qu&index=56) - 1hr.
## üìù Notes / Thoughts:
While still working on the design system in the React code at work, I encountered an issue with using some shadcn components to create custom components. Apparently it has to do with ref forwarding (this is no longer an issue in React 19). I definitely have to create some time to look into ref forwarding this week.

I'm still in the process of getting my sleep schedule on lock. Hopefully by the end of this week.

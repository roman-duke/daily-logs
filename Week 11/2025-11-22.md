## 📝 Notes / Thoughts:
Working on ui work can really be annoying. I despise having to pay so attention to user experience and thinking of edge cases. 

Drawing the head in extreme angles using the Loomis method is not easy. I have just been messing up the proportions so much! I have barely made any progress and this is already Day 3, arghhh. 27 days left. I definitely have to be much more serious now.

In summary, the day was largely unproductive.

## Date: 23rd November, 2025.
## 🎯 Mini Goals for the Day:
- Chess (Estimated time - 30mins) ✅:
	- Play and analyse at least 1 game of Chess. 
	- Solve at least 5 Healthy Mix of Lichess Puzzles.
- "Tasks at Work" (Estimated total time - 7hrs):
	- Start looking at website designs for the schools.
- Drawing Challenge Practice Day 4! (Estimated total time - 5hrs):
	- Practice the Loomis method for different heads.
	- Attempt to draw a portrait of the guy in the random sub-folder of drawing challenges folder.
## 📖 What I worked on:
- Played and analysed 2 games of Chess. W1D1 - 45 mins.
- "Tasks at Work" (Front office website design research and implementation start) - 4hrs.
- Drawing Challenge Practice Day 4 - 2.5hrs.
## 📝 Notes / Thoughts:
While working on tasks at work today, I hit a roadblock that led me to do some research and come up with some slightly nuanced solution (implementing a custom SSG in Express). I haven't implemented it yet, but plan to do so during the week.

Weaknesses that I have identified in my drawing include shading, extreme angles via the Loomis method and identifying the minor planes in facial features (lips and nose). I shall attempt to drill these for about 3 days, starting from the 25th of November.

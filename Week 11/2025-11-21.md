## Date: 21st November, 2025.
## 🎯 Mini Goals for the Day:

	- Play and analyse at least 2 game of Chess.

## 📖 What I worked on:
- Played and analysed 2 games of Chess. W1D1 - 45 mins.
- "Tasks at work" - 1hr.
## 📝 Notes / Thoughts:
I got to an all time high Lichess rating of 1400. I wanted to achieve it in 500 games, but I did it in 501. Well, not what I desired but also not the most terrible outcome. The target was actually 1600 by the end of the year, but that is extremely difficult now (basically out of reach) especially because I am on maintenance mode in Chess. Anyways, I'll still keep playing and see where I get.

With regards to everything else, it was a very unproductive day, lolll. I can't afford to be doing this at this crucial period. I'm seriously lagging behind. We go again tomorrow, I guess.

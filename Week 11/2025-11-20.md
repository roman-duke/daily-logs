## 📝 Notes / Thoughts:
Not much was achieved today. I had quite a bit of meetings (this was quite draining, loll). At least I was able to get in 2 hours of drawing practice. "Nostro tempo" has greatly suffered this week. I definitely have to switch back to normal working mode (not tunnel vision) and distribute the hours accordingly.

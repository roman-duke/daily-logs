## 📖 What I worked on:
- Played and anaysed 1 games of Chess. W1 - 30 mins.
- Attempt 10 Healthy mix of Lichess puzzles. - 1 hr.
- "Tasks at Work" (worked on the steps 2 and 3 of the onboarding form and improved the design of the onboarding flow). - 8hrs.
## 📝 Notes / Thoughts:
The Lichess Puzzles were a disaster, loll. I lost a lot of rating points by trying to grind a lot in a short span of time. The actual play (rapid chess) is still on maintenance mode (playing just about 1 or 2 games everyday). 

The tasks at work took much longer than expected. I had to do quite a bit of research about IP geolocation, Google Maps Places Autocomplete API and how onboarding forms are typically structured.

I was so tired, I couldn't get Day 2 of drawing practice in. That's sad, but  I have to bounce back by putting in the extra hours during the weekend.

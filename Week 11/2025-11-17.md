## 📝 Notes / Thoughts:
I really dislike meetings, haha. I dread the days we have them at work (it takes an additional 30 minutes to context switch back to whatever it was that I was working on). Anyways, nothing particularly spectacular happened today, it was mainly just work tasks. I narrowed focus to just that and had barely any time left for the other endeavours.

The drawing practice has officially begun. It's kind of scary though, haha. It'd be interesting to see how it turns out though.

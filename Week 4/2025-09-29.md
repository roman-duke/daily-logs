## Date: 29th September, 2025.

## 📖 What I worked on:
- Played and Analyzed 3 Chess games: 1hr
- "Work": 1.5hrs
- Backend of the Nostro tempo application: 1.5hrs
## 📝 Notes / Thoughts:
A slow start to the week actually. Due to the fact that I woke up late on a gym day, I barely had enough hours in the day to dedicate to work. Working on the custom error handling middleware function in Express was the main positive of the day.

## Date: 30th September, 2025.

## 🎯 Mini Goals for the Day:
- Play and Analyze 2 Chess games. ✅
- Solve 5 Healthy Mix of Chess Puzzles.
- Refactor the CRUD of the questions resource in the nostro tempo application ✅
- Read first chapter of the Mathematical Proofs book.
- Work on 1 Leetcode problem.
## 📖 What I worked on:
- Played and Analyzed 2 Chess games - 1.5hrs.
- Watched Gotham Chess' video on Time Management in Chess - 45mins.
- "Work" - 1hr
- Completed 80% of the refactor for the question in nostro tempo - 4hrs.
## 📝 Notes / Thoughts:
My time management in Chess has been a serious problem for as long as I can remember. I looked up some tips on improving that on Reddit, then I watched a Gotham Chess video. The refactor has been going okay, but much slower than expected because for each feature I want to implement, I come up with a solution, analyze it and then look online for better ideas.

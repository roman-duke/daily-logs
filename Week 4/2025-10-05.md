## Date: 5th October, 2025.

## 🎯 Mini Goals for the Day:
- Play and Analyze 2 Chess game. ✅
- Solve at least 3 Lichess puzzles. ✅
- Catchup on tasks that are set to be due soon at my job.
## 📖 What I worked on:
- Played and Analyzed 2 Chess games - 45 mins.
- Solved 3 Lichess Puzzles - 10 mins.
- Researched and noted down some open source react applications to read.
## 📝 Notes / Thoughts:
Read about class variance authority and realised how poorly I'd been making custom components in all the React projects I'd previously worked on. After that, I spent a good chunk of the time just trying to find some open source applications built in React just so that I see some best practices and patterns used in the industry. 

Chess was fun today, I need to really work on my time management skills though.

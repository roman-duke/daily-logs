## Date: 3rd October, 2025.

## 🎯 Mini Goals for the Day:
- Play and Analyze 2 Chess game. ✅
- Solve 10 Healthy Mix of Chess Puzzles.
- Work on the repository layer in the questions resource, refactor the CRUD for the categories service and then work on users creating trivia sessions and questions being graded. 
- Read first chapter of the Mathematical Proofs book.
- Work on 1 Leetcode problem.
## 📖 What I worked on:
- Played and Analyzed 3 Chess games - 1hr.
- Completed the custom schema mapper function from [[2025-10-02 |yesterday]] - 2hrs.
## 📝 Notes / Thoughts:
I was only able to cross out one main mini goal yesterday. For the nostro temp application, progress was made working on the custom mapper function. However due to analysis paralysis on how to transform data returned from the db and whether to validate it, I was not able to cross out the actual mini-goals set for the day. 

I have basically carried over the Leetcode and Mathematical Proofs tasks all week. Ideally, they are doable but I have essentially been clowning on the amount of work hours poured into my endeavours.

## Date: 1st October, 2025.

## 🎯 Mini Goals for the Day:
- Play and Analyze 1 Chess game. ✅
- Solve 5 Healthy Mix of Chess Puzzles. ✅
- Watch Daniel Naroditsky's speedrun video. ✅
- Refactor the CRUD of the questions resource in the nostro tempo application. ✅
- Read first chapter of the Mathematical Proofs book.
- Work on 1 Leetcode problem.
## 📖 What I worked on:
- Watched Daniel Naroditsky's speedrun video - 1.5hrs.
- Played and Analyzed 1 Chess game - 30 mins.
- Solved 7 Healthy Mix of Lichess Puzzles - 23 mins.
- Integrated error handling wrapper in nostro tempo - 3 hours.
## 📝 Notes / Thoughts:
Came across other JS backend web frameworks like Koa, Fastify and Hono. These are interesting options that I would most likely migrate to after the MVP of nostro tempo. I probably won't try NestJS because of how opinionated it is and also the decorator function style that's very "Spring-like" in nature (since I am already going to explore Spring with Java, I would prefer to try a different paradigm when coding in Javascript). Also, I realized a gap in my knowledge on asynchronous programming and the event loop in Javascript.

The Chess progress seems to be rather slow, but I just have to stick to it and see how far I can get in about 3 weeks.

I didn't work enough today, sadly I would have to skip sleep tonight and achieve some of the goals I set out to.

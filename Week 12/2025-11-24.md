## 📝 Notes / Thoughts:
There was no drawing practice today 😭😭. I am falling so far behind, damn. Now is no time to lament though. I shall pickup the pace as soon as possible.

Damn, I hate having to attend meetings at work jeez. It legit burns a lot of time. Basically the whole day was spent having meetings, loll. Thankfully, that is to reduce in the coming weeks.

My Chess is largely still on maintenance mode, haha. But sadly there isn't much I can do at the moment. There's just so many other things I have to work on and there's not enough time to pour into chess.

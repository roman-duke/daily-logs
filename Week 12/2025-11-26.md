## Date: 26th November, 2025.
## 🎯 Mini Goals for the Day:

	- Play and analyse at least 1 game of Chess. 
- "Tasks at Work" (Estimated total time - 6hrs) ✅:
	- Complete the Authentication of the backoffice application.
	- Read how error handling is done in industry standard and update code accordingly.
	- Refine and finalise the onboarding flow.
- Drawing Challenge Practice Day 6! (Estimated total time - 3hrs):
	- Practice the Loomis method (at least 5 drawings).
	- Practice quick sketches of 10 different portrait (focusing mainly on the line work).

## 📖 What I worked on:
- Played and analysed 3 games of Chess. W2D1L2 - 2hrs.
- "Tasks at work" (spent the entirety of the day first reading how error handling is done in production-grade software in the industry, then I roughly completed the first version of the authentication) - 9hrs.
## 📝 Notes / Thoughts:
I think I am underperforming my Chess rating potential. The amount of games I lose due to poor time management and being flagged is crazy. This is particularly the case when I get matched up with much higher rated opponents. I spend so long thinking in relatively quiet positions.

I spent much longer than I budgeted working on the authentication and refining the onboarding flow of my tasks at work.

I lost the rhythm towards the end of the day and wasn't able to draw. I have to pay the price by sacrificing sleep (I napped during the day, so I surprisingly don't feel tired) for the night to get in the missed drawing session in.

## 😴 Sleep :
- Wakeup time: 3:00am.
- Naptime: 11:20am - 12:50pm
- Bedtime: _No sleep for the wicked._

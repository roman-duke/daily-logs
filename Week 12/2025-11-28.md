## 📖 What I worked on:
- "Tasks at Work" - 1hr
## 📝 Notes / Thoughts:
I spent just a bit of time trying to debug why I was getting flickers of the "protected" routes in react router, using the Navigate component.

A very unproductive day with regards to work. A very close friend from University came over. This drawing challenge is looking ever more unrealistic at this point. If I did "lock in" now and didn't miss a day for 24 days, I would be ending the challenge on Christmas day.

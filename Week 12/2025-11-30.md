## Date: 30th November, 2025.
## 🎯 Mini Goals for the Day:
- Chess (Estimated time - 1hr) ✅:
	- Review your past Chess losses and play at most 2 games of Chess.
- "Tasks at work" (Estimated time - 7hrs) ✅:
	- Work on the the school profile creation flow in the dashboard.
	- Begin work on the website builder feature in the dashboard.
## 📖 What I worked on:
- Played and analyzed 2 games of Chess. W2 - 2hrs.
- "Tasks at work" (I spent basically the entirety of the day trying to implement a custom ssg in vite). - 6hrs
## 📝 Notes / Thoughts:
The whole concept of SSRs and SSGs is quite fascinating. There's still a bit to properly dig into after I am done with the MVP of the product that is being built at work. Essentially, the whole flow involves rendering of the JSX to html on the server and then hydrating afterwards (on the client side).

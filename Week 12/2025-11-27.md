## Date: 27th November, 2025.
## 🎯 Mini Goals for the Day:
- Chess (Estimated time - 45mins) ✅:
	- Play and analyse at least 1 game of Chess. 
- "Tasks at Work" (Estimated total time - 6hrs) ✅:
	- Complete the Authentication of the backoffice application.
	- Read how error handling is done in industry standard and update code accordingly.
	- Refine and finalise the onboarding flow.
## 📖 What I worked on:
- Played and analysed 5 games of Chess. W2L3 - 2hrs.
- "Tasks at work" (updated the authentication code a bit and worked on some ui screens). - 4hrs.
## 📝 Notes / Thoughts:
I played way too much Chess games today, loll.

I considered giving up on the Drawing challenge and focusing solely on work, but this is something that I have already committed too. I do not want it to be yet another abandoned project. I have missed a few days now, but there's still some time to get the 25 remaining days in.

I watched a talk today about this cracked Engineer at Microsoft called David Fowler. It was an eye opener about the insane gulf in skill level between the different tiers of software engineers. I need to try and get my act together if I really want to leave the foothills of mediocrity.

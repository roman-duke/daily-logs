## 📝 Notes / Thoughts:
It seems as though I am not making any progress in the drawing challenge, perhaps because of how inconsistent I have been thus far. I haven't yet drilled my weaknesses and I have just 24 days left, loll.

I've taken my foot off the gas a bit the past few days actually, ughh. There's nothing much to say, I'm just disappointed and a bit sad, I guess. But I must not falter now.
